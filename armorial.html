                This section of the Armorial represents a collection
                of heraldic emblems that are intimately associated
                with the individual identities within the House of
                Basu-Howard. Each emblem here has been personally
                adopted by members of the house, reflecting their
                achievements, interests, and the personal ethos they
                bring to the family legacy.  These symbols are not
                just identity markers but are a living narrative of
                each memberâ€™s journey and contributions to the
                house. As each member selects or designs their
                heraldic symbol, they add to the evolving story of
                our lineage, embedding their personal touch within
                our shared heritage.
