The blazon of Dr Howard's arms—Argent in pale a tetrahedron Azure
pierced in bend by a sword Or with pommel and cross piece of the Second.
Upon a helm befitting his degree with mantling Azure and doubled Or is
set for crest, upon a wreath of the liveries a martlet
Sable—encapsulates his professional identity. The tetrahedron represents
Dr. Howard's work in mathematics, while the sword, inspired by the seal
of Cincinnati, Ohio, links his heraldic identity to significant personal
locales and narratives of nobility and valor. The martlet crest,
suggested by Count Gauci, symbolizes perpetual quest and ambition,
embodying his relentless pursuit of knowledge and excellence.

Dr. Howard has developed multiple emblazonments and adapted his coat of
arms into flags, banners, and badges, ensuring its versatile
application. The English and Scottish heraldic badges, featuring the
martlet and sword, symbolize continuous effort and strength. These
symbols represent his dedication to scholarship, teaching, and service.
The motto, "_Ir-rieda biss tmexxi l-qalb_" ("Only the will leads the
heart"), underscores the importance of determination and inner strength
in guiding one's passions and decisions. This motto, suggested by Count
Gauci as the first Maltese motto seen in his term, highlights a unique
cultural contribution to the heraldic tradition.
