                <h4 class="card-title">What is heraldry?</h4>

                <p><strong>Heraldry</strong> is the practice of
                    designing, displaying, describing, and recording
                    coats of arms and heraldic badges. It originated in
                    medieval Europe and has since evolved into a
                    tradition that represents familial, institutional,
                    and national identities.  Heraldic symbols are used
                    to convey lineage, achievements, and values.</p>

                <h4 class="card-title">What is the significance of the
                Maltese Cross?</h4>

                <p>The <strong>Maltese Cross</strong> is an
                    eight-pointed cross that is deeply associated with
                    the Knights Hospitaller, who ruled Malta from 1530
                    to 1798. The eight points of the cross represent the
                    eight obligations or aspirations of the Knights.
                    Today, the Maltese Cross is a symbol of Malta's rich
                    history and cultural heritage.</p>

                <h4 class="card-title">What are mottoes, and how are
                they used in heraldry?</h4>

                <p><strong>Mottoes</strong> are phrases or maxims that
                    often appear on coats of arms, typically placed
                    below the shield. They are intended to express the
                    values, principles, or aspirations of the
                    individual, family, or institution represented by
                    the arms. Our directory of mottoes on Araldika
                    provides a list of these phrases, along with their
                    meanings and origins.</p>

        <h1>Maltese Heraldry</h1>

        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body mt-n4">

                <h4 class="card-title">What is the role of the Chief
                Herald of Malta?</h4>

                <p>The <a href="https://heritagemalta.mt/subsidiaries/heraldry/">Chief
                Herald of Malta</a> is responsible for overseeing and
                regulating heraldic practices in Malta. Established in
                2019, the Office of the Chief Herald grants new coats of
                arms, registers existing ones, and promotes heraldic
                research and education. The Chief Herald ensures that
                Malta's heraldic traditions are preserved and
                respected.</p>

                <h4 class="card-title">What is a general armory?</h4>

                <p>A general armory is a comprehensive collection or
                registry of coats of arms, typically organized by
                country or region. At Araldika, our general armory
                features a curated selection of Maltese coats of arms,
                complete with detailed descriptions, blazoning, and
                historical context. It serves as a valuable resource for
                anyone interested in Maltese heraldry.</p>

                <h4 class="card-title">What is an ordinary of arms and
                an ordinary of crests?</h4>

                <p>An ordinary of arms and an ordinary of crests are
                classification systems used in heraldry to organize
                coats of arms and crests by their elements, such as
                charges, colors, and arrangements. These ordinaries help
                users identify and compare heraldic symbols based on
                their visual characteristics, making it easier to trace
                connections and study the development of heraldic
                art.</p>

                <h4 class="card-title">How can I find out if my family
                has a coat of arms?</h4>

                <p>If you suspect your family has a coat of arms, you
                can start by researching historical records, family
                documents, or consulting our general armory on Araldika.
                You may also contact the Office of the Chief Herald of
                Malta for assistance in verifying or registering a coat
                of arms.</p>

                <h4 class="card-title">Can I create my own coat of
                arms?</h4>

                <p>In Malta, the creation of a new coat of arms is
                regulated by the Office of the Chief Herald. If you are
                interested in having a coat of arms designed or granted,
                you should contact the Chief Herald, who can guide you
                through the process and ensure that the design adheres
                to heraldic principles and traditions.</p>
